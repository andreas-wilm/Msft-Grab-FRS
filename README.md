# Introduction

Hello students! ðŸ‘‹ This Future Ready Skills Grab Challenge provides a self-paced learning path for data science and machine learning. After completing foundational content on Microsoft Learn, a challenge using Grab data will be available for you to test your skills.

Students with no prior introduction to data science and machine learning are suitable for this course.

# Get started

Complete the foundation modules on Microsoft Learn below. These will cover core concepts needed to succeed at the challenge:

1. [Introduction to machine learning with Python and Azure Notebooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/intro-to-ml-with-python/) (2 hr 11 min)
2. [Introduction to Data Science in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-data-science-in-azure/) (55 min)
3. [Choose the Data Science service in Azure you need](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/choose-data-science-option-in-azure/) (45 min)

# Solve the challenge!

Choose one of the following Future Ready Skills Challenges:

1. [Safety](https://github.com/yingjia-liu/Msft-Grab-FRS/tree/master/Safety)
2. [Traffic Management](https://github.com/yingjia-liu/Msft-Grab-FRS/tree/master/Traffic_Management)


We suggest to start your work on Azure Notebooks, a free and Microsoft hosted Jupyter Notebook service. This allows you to explore the data and write some code in your web browser, without having to install software locally. Note that there are many other and more specialised services that allow you to work with the data (and we are happy to suggest alternatives). To track code changes over time we will use Github, which will also allow you to easily change systems later, if needed. Follow [this link](./getting-started-with-anb-and-github.md), to read how to get started working using Azure Notebooks and Github.

# Submission

Either make your Azure Notebook public and share the URL in the Microsoft Teams channel or add us as collaborator to your Github repository containing the solution.

All the best ðŸ˜ƒ
